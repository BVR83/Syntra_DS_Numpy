# Syntra_DS_Numpy

This repository contains a collection of Python functions for image manipulation using NumPy and Matplotlib.
This repository is created as part of the Syntra Data science course 2024 given by Tim Hellemans

## Created functions

### `add_hor`
Support function to tile an image horizontally for a specific amount
### `add_vert`
Support function to tile an image vertically for a specific amount
### `tile_img`
Tile a given image based on a vertical and horizontal value
### `tile_img_matrix`
Tile a given image based on the shape of a matrix
### `tile_array_directions`
Tile a given image vertically and define the mirroring per row
### `tilemirror_matrix`
Tile and mirror a given image based on a np array
### `enlargeImgBorder`
Rescale the main image and add the image as padding around the given image
### `word`
Generate an image representing the given text using letters from an alphabet image.
### `add_border`
Add a border around the given imahe

## NOTES

All functions contain a docstring and errorhandling for the arguments.\
The repository contains a .yaml file which specifies the python environment used while creating these functions.\
**IMPORTANT!** All functions except the support functions intentionally only output images using matplotlib and they do not return the numpy array. \

#### TO TEST THE FUNCTIONS
Please open **exercise.py** in visual studio code and find an example of all included functions commented out. \
Please uncomment any function to test and explore the function. \
You can find all functions in functions.py.\
\
**Have fun exploring my python image manipulation functions!!!**
